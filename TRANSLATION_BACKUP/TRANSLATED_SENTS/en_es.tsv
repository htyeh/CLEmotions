So you are in Finland or Israel? Edit: that is kind of funny, I said that, THEN clicked on your profile, and sure enough 	1,7	ef8u8mu
Wasn't me I'm the defensive [NAME]. But trust me we were all equally confused, and delighted.	10	edn8wy9
Ok. Got it. Thanks	15	eehajow

[NAME] can get the web action, ja feel?	27	ef09bxu
So unsatisfying that it didn’t end with a pit maneuver.	9	eder8d1

He dunked all the time with us. Loved the reverse two hand slam	27	ee0tzvm
[NAME] is doing that since season 1. Even [NAME] commented in S1 that everytime sometimes is up, [NAME] inserts herself into argument. It's her MO.	27	edklzdx
