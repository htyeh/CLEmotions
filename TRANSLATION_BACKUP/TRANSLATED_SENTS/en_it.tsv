Stop arguing with people.	10	edbo037
Hopefully you don't come across too many crews like that yourself though. Always better when the combat is honorable.	20	edm7igz
Caution: [NAME]	27	eepr6u3
Is that supposed to be outrageous? Assuming he met the requirements and earned them all, good on the guy for planning for his future.	4	eema5gu
He also had bipolar depression, which was a major driver in his mental states...	27	edez73c
That’s a statement I can actually get behind. Not because of anything he’s really done, but that Scientology stuff is... weird.	3	ee2yq0u
Cat looks like it’s going to tell you about how much better going vegan is, or how much money she saved on cutting her own bangs.	27	ed82o39
No insults.	27	ef7p8hv
Something tells me she just got it too.	27	efbpncx
OK. You’re not distinguishing yourself from an anti-theist. >[RELIGION] [NAME] I said ‘a god’.	27	ef4d3fb
[NAME] is also a Vikings fan. I'd love to have him on the longboat.	18	edhix01
Hahahaha!! I was thinking the exact same thing. But you could really feel the excitement while reading! 10/10	1,17	eemyi9e

Ok, I gots to know, was the child taken away? Please tell me the child was taken away. 	7	ef9f2fx
I don't know why you even talk to human trash like this. Instead you should motivate him to leave her - at least that would be productive.	27	edmcs0g
Good luck going to jail.	3	ee85jm2

That’s always good to be away from toxic people like that. Try to keep yourself from those types of people, they can ruin your life.	4,5	ed8mq8n
Imagine being so indoctrinated, that you believe that any place that doesn't actually talk shit about [NAME] constantly is a right wing circle jerk. 	27	efcxrjg
It looks like Livonia flipped light blue as well? That’s pretty impressive.	0	ed7gapg

I just don't think [NAME] is the guy to do something like this.	27	edcaslh
They didn’t cite a source. On top of the spelling mistakes. It’s why you don’t trust infographics for stats.	27	ee3c4di
They’re looking at her like they wish they’d ordered her instead.	27	ee6yjv1
