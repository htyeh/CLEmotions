You mean Ichigo/Nero/Black Ranger/I'm a Frog. Did not know that [NAME] voiced [NAME], but it does exsplain why he sounded so familiar.	26	edact8p
From his username I can tell he lives in a city close to me. I'm sorry everyone, Vermont has better to offer than the likes of him	24	edgasry
It's common enough that we have a specific term for them. We called them PX Rangers. The PX is the on-post department store.	27	eeq5sy2
Ah, I forgot humor can be objectively measured. 	22	efgi8hp
I personally like Picard better. But Kirk must have been more fun to write.	27	ef8xhzs
That's ironic. Because [NAME] isn't getting the Wall funded, we are pulling more resources off the border blockade effort?	27	eellsi5
Thanks for this. I appreciate everyone involved.	15	edq1lsu
